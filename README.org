PARIETAL: Yet another deeP leARnIng brain ExTrAtion tooL

** Why another skull-stripping method?
During the last years, we have happily use each of the already available tools that have been proposed. However, these methods are not always accurate enough for our needs or when accurate, they are slow for fast inference. Hopefully, several brain MRI datasets have been released, such as the [[https://sites.google.com/view/calgary-campinas-dataset/home][Campinas]] dataset, permitting researchers to train deep learning models that hopefully will reduce both the accuracy and time drawbacks.

In this aspect, several deep learning method have been already proposed for accurate brain extraction. PARIETAL is another one, trying to perform a fast and protocol independent skull extraction. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments show a high performance on different datasets, even without retraining on unseen protocols.

** Architecture:
PARIETAL is based on patch based residual [[http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06650][3D-UNET]] (see figure). Initially, it has been trained using the =silver-masks= provided by the
[[https://sites.google.com/view/calgary-campinas-dataset/home][Calgary-Campinas-359]] dataset. The dataset is composed of 359 images of older healthy adults (29-80 years) acquired on Siemens, Philips and General Electric at both 1.5T and 3T (see Souza et al. 2017) for more information about the dataset. In all the experiments, inference has been performed using the trained model on the Campinas dataset, *analyzing the capability of the learned architecture on unseen data and image protocols and*.

*** Training/inference Characteristics:
- Input modalities: =T1=
- Training patch size: =32x32x32=
- Training sampling: balanced training, same number of brain and skull samples (non-brain) after sampling at =16x16x16=
- Optimizer: =Adadelta=
- Training batch size: =32=
- Training epochs: =200=
- Train loss: =cross entropy=
- Early stopping: =50 epochs (based on validation DSC)=
- Inference patch size: =32x32x32=
- Inference sampling: =16x16x16=

** Installation:
PARIETAL uses the amazing [[www.pytorch.org][Pytorch]] deep learning toolkit. All necessary packages can be installed from =pip= as follows:

#+begin_src python
pip install -r requirements
#+end_src

** How to use it:
In order to run the PARIETAL model, just run =python run_skull.py --help= to see all the available options:

#+begin_SEC bash
python run_skull.py --help
#+end_src

*** Mandatory parameters:
- input_image (=--input_image=): T1 nifti image to process
- out_name (=--out_name=): Output name for the skull-stripped image

*** Optional parameters:
- binary threshold (=--threshold=): output threshold used to binarize the skull-stripped image (default=0.5)
- gpu use (=--gpu=): use GPU for faster inference (default=No)
- gpu number (=--gpu_number=): Which GPU number to use (default=0)
- trained model (=--model=): Trained model to use to perform the inference (default: Campinas model)
- verbose (=--verbose=): show useful information

*** GPU vs CPU use:
The model can run with both GPU or a decent CPU. In most of the experiments performed, PARIETAL can perform the brain extraction of a T1-w image in less than 10 seconds when using GPU and about 2 minutes when running on the CPU (see performance experiments for a more complete analysis).

** Performance:
We have compared the performance of PARIETAL with several state-of-the-art tools already available and also with respect to some other deep learning methods. In other to do so, we have run PARIETAL on different public available datasets such as [[http://www.oasis-brains.org/][OASIS]], [[https://resource.loni.usc.edu/resources/atlases-downloads/][LPBA40]] and the [[https://sites.google.com/view/calgary-campinas-dataset/home][Campinas]] dataset.

*** OASIS dataset

/In progress/

*** Processing time:

Finally, we analyze the processing time (in seconds) of the proposed architecture against other methods in the field. For the PARIETAL method, we show the processing times with/without loading the model in the GPU for each new example. This is the case when the model is not used in =batch mode= (to implement).

Computing times from all methods but PARIETAL have been extracted from the same [[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2019.06.008][Lucena et al. 2019]] paper, where the authors report the use of a workstation equipped with a =Xeon E3-1220 v3, 4x3.10Ghz, Intel)=. GPU resources are the identical in all the deep learning methods (=NVIDIA TITAN-X GPU, 12GB)=.
